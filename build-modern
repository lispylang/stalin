# Stalin Modern Build Script
# =========================
#
# This script builds the Stalin Scheme compiler with modern compatibility fixes.
# It addresses issues that arise when compiling the 2006-era codebase on modern
# systems, particularly around:
# - ARM64 architecture support (which didn't exist in 2006)
# - Modern C compiler standards and warnings
# - Cross-platform build system compatibility
#
# The script performs three main phases:
# 1. Architecture detection and compiler flag setup
# 2. Boehm Garbage Collector compilation with ARM64 fixes
# 3. Stalin compiler compilation with modern C standards
#
# Author: Claude Code Development Team
# Date: 2024

# Exit immediately if any command fails
# This ensures we catch build errors early rather than continuing with broken state

# MODERN COMPILER COMPATIBILITY FLAGS
# ===================================
# These flags address issues with compiling 2006-era C code on modern compilers

# C99 standard compliance with warnings suppression for legacy code
# -std=c99: Use C99 standard (Stalin predates this but is mostly compatible)
# -Wno-implicit-function-declaration: Suppress warnings for undeclared functions (common in old code)
# -Wno-int-conversion: Suppress warnings for pointer/integer conversion (legacy pointer handling)

# ARCHITECTURE DETECTION AND CONFIGURATION
# ========================================

# which one to use and what compiler flags are appropriate
