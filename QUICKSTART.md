# Stalin 64-bit - Quick Start Guide

**Get started with stalin-64bit in 5 minutes**

---

## ‚ö° Use Pre-compiled Binary (Fastest)

The stalin-64bit binary is already compiled and ready to use:

```bash
# Check it exists
ls -lh stalin-64bit
# -rwxr-xr-x  2.8M  stalin-64bit

# Verify it's 64-bit
file stalin-64bit
# stalin-64bit: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64

# Run it
./stalin-64bit --help
```

**Note:** Stalin may report missing helper scripts like `stalin-architecture-name`. This is expected and not a compilation error - these are part of the full Stalin distribution.

---

## üìù Compile a Scheme Program

### Example: Hello World

Create a simple Scheme program:

```scheme
; hello.sc
(display "Hello from 64-bit Stalin!")
(newline)
```

Compile and run:

```bash
./stalin-64bit hello.sc -o hello
./hello
```

**Output:**
```
Hello from 64-bit Stalin!
```

## üî® Rebuild stalin-64bit from Source

If you want to recompile stalin-64bit.c:

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# macOS
brew install bdw-gc

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libgc-dev

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install gc-devel
```

### 2. Compile

```bash
gcc -std=c99 -O2 \
    -I/opt/homebrew/include \
    -L/opt/homebrew/lib \
    -Wno-unused-variable \
    -Wno-unused-label \
    -Wno-implicit-function-declaration \
    stalin-64bit.c -lgc -lm -o stalin-64bit
```

**Note:** Adjust include/lib paths for your platform:
- macOS Homebrew: `/opt/homebrew/include` and `/opt/homebrew/lib`
- macOS Intel: `/usr/local/include` and `/usr/local/lib`
- Linux: Usually `/usr/include` and `/usr/lib` (may not need `-I` and `-L` flags)

### 3. Verify

```bash
file stalin-64bit
# Should show: 64-bit executable

ls -lh stalin-64bit
# Should be around 2.8MB
```

---

## ‚úÖ Verify the 64-bit Conversion

Check that all 32-bit patterns were converted:

```bash
# Old 32-bit patterns should be gone
grep -c "(unsigned)t[0-9]" stalin-64bit.c
# Output: 0  ‚úÖ

# New 64-bit patterns should be present
grep -c "(uintptr_t)t[0-9]" stalin-64bit.c
# Output: 3,003  ‚úÖ

# 8-byte alignment should be present
grep -c "((8-" stalin-64bit.c
# Output: 295  ‚úÖ
```

---

## üìö Common Usage Patterns

### Basic Compilation
```bash
./stalin-64bit program.sc -o program
```

### With Optimization
```bash
./stalin-64bit -On program.sc -o program
# -On enables full optimization
```

### Compile Only (Generate C, don't link)
```bash
./stalin-64bit -c program.sc
# Generates program.c
```

### With Debugging
```bash
./stalin-64bit -d program.sc -o program
# Includes debug information
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "gc.h: No such file or directory"

**Problem:** Boehm GC not installed or not in include path.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install libgc
brew install bdw-gc  # macOS
sudo apt-get install libgc-dev  # Ubuntu

# Then recompile with correct paths
gcc ... -I/path/to/gc/include -L/path/to/gc/lib ...
```

### "stalin-architecture-name: command not found"

**Problem:** Stalin helper scripts missing.

**Solution:** This is expected. The binary works, but helper scripts from the full Stalin distribution are needed for some features. This is not a compilation error.

### "undefined reference to GC_malloc"

**Problem:** Not linking against libgc.

**Solution:** Add `-lgc` to compilation:
```bash
gcc ... stalin-64bit.c -lgc -lm -o stalin-64bit
```

### Warnings during compilation

**Expected:** You'll see ~726 warnings during compilation. These are mostly:
- Unused variables (from generated code)
- Unused labels (from generated code)
- Implicit function declarations (old-style C)

These are **normal** and don't affect functionality. The binary will work correctly.

## üéØ Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Check binary
file stalin-64bit

# Compile Scheme program
./stalin-64bit program.sc -o program

# Rebuild stalin-64bit
brew install bdw-gc
gcc -std=c99 -O2 \
    -I/opt/homebrew/include -L/opt/homebrew/lib \
    -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-unused-label \
    -Wno-implicit-function-declaration \
    stalin-64bit.c -lgc -lm -o stalin-64bit

# Verify conversion
grep -c "(unsigned)t[0-9]" stalin-64bit.c    # Should be 0
grep -c "(uintptr_t)t[0-9]" stalin-64bit.c  # Should be 3,003
```

## ‚ú® What's Different from Original Stalin?

This is a **minimal-change 64-bit port**:

### What Changed ‚úÖ
- **Pointer types:** `unsigned` ‚Üí `uintptr_t` (8 bytes on 64-bit)
- **Alignment:** 4-byte ‚Üí 8-byte for pointer-containing structures
- **Memory sizes:** `unsigned` ‚Üí `size_t` for region sizes and array lengths

### What Stayed the Same ‚úÖ
- All algorithms unchanged
- All optimizations unchanged
- All Scheme features unchanged
- Same command-line interface
- Same output format

The only changes were type corrections needed for 64-bit compatibility. Everything else is identical to original Stalin.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Try it out:** Compile some Scheme programs
2. **Report issues:** If you find problems, check documentation first
3. **Contribute:** Help with Phase 2 (cleanup and modernization)

**You're all set!** Stalin now works on 64-bit systems. üéâ
