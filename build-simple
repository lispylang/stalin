# Stalin Simple Build Script
# ==========================
#
# This is a simplified build script that bypasses complex Boehm GC compilation
# issues by using a minimal garbage collector stub. This approach is faster and
# more reliable for initial development and testing, but may not be suitable for
# production use where the full GC is needed for performance.
#
# Use this script when:
# - The full build-modern script fails due to GC compilation issues
# - You need a quick working Stalin compiler for testing
# - You're working on a system where the Boehm GC doesn't compile
# - You don't need the full garbage collection features
#
# Limitations:
# - Uses system malloc/free instead of Boehm conservative GC
# - May have memory leaks in long-running programs
# - Missing some GC-specific optimizations
# - Not recommended for production Stalin usage
